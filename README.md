# ProjectHandbook

This repo contains the LaTeX code for the creation of the Project Handbook for Media Technology's 3rd year project module. It's purpose is to be a difinitive document on the project module itself and how to create it, but also to serve as an example LaTeX document that can be referenced for those that want to attempt to typeset their reports in LaTex. 

Beware that this is not the ideal format for a report, however, more an example of some of the techniques and methods in play when typesetting with LaTeX. If you want to attempt to make your report in this way, consult your supervisor or me to decide on a reasonable template. It might be prudent to collaboratively develop this!
