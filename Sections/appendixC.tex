\chapter{Statement of Goodwill}

This part of your degree and academic life is important, and it can feel daunting. This document serves as a communications channel to portray the rules and guidance to obtaining a good project outcome. However, it should also serve as a comfort, and a heartfelt \textbf{good luck} to you throughout this year and your further careers and lives.

You are incredibly important to Solent University, and the Media Technology group within it, and you are about to join a long history of excellent graduates out there now \textit{making it happen.} You're part of a family now, and we'll always be there to help if we can. 

Good luck with the project!
