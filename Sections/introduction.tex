\chapter{Introduction}

This module is designed to provide the student with the opportunity to conduct a self-managed project of significant scale and complexity, in which the student creates a project outcome which provides a solution to an identified technical problem or challenge.

The project should reflect theory and practice drawn from the degree being undertaken by the student and should also reflect their particular interests. The project may focus on the areas of technical development, research or operational practice, but each project must aim to address a specifically identified problem, research question, or technical challenge.

The output of the project could take the form of hardware, software, practical implementation of a new or experimental technique, or a research dataset. Students will be encouraged to undertake projects that are related to real world applications, and may work on live briefs from industry partners. The completed project should reflect the studentâ€™s ability to plan, execute and present the findings from an endeavor of their own choosing.
