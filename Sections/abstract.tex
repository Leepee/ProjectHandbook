\chapter{Foreword}

This document is intended to give the long-format, structured guidance for your project submissions in your final year. It is intended to be exhaustive. However, there are instances where you will need to consult with project supervisors or the module leaders for help and advice. Please do not hesitate to do so. 

If you find any inconsistency in the documentation, please alert and consult the module leader in good time. 

Very best of luck with your project and submissions, and in your future careers.
